Setup Instructions:

NOTE: If your order or one of your USBs does not have a password label attached, it is because it is configured to be used with a Windows or Linux machine, and the encryption algorithms could not be set by us due to incompatibility. Currently, we only support USB encryption for MacOS Cold Storage Wallets, however as long as you set a secure password for your wallet, your assets cannot be reached and your wallet itself will still be encrypted.
